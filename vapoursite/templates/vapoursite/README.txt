COMP3297 Group Project Iteration 1 - Inception
User Interface Prototypes (HTML)

This directory contains skeleton HTML implementations of the most important frames of the UI Prototypes (Paper Drafts). There may be some differences between the two protoypes due to implementation issues with the latter, in which case the on-paper design takes precedence. THIS IS NOT THE FINAL LAYOUT OF THE FCP PROJECT.

Viewing Notes:
     - This implementation uses the Bootstrap Framework (https://getbootstrap.com/). The CSS requires an internet connection to work.
     - All components of UIP(HTML) have been confirmed to work only on Chromium 56.0. There are confirmed issues in Firefox and Internet Explorer. When viewing the files, please use this browser or Google Chrome.

Unresolved Issues:
     - In game-detail.html, only one modal, or pop-up (for tag creation) works at a time (by default, the Add Tag pop-up). In order to view the Modify/Delete Tag pop-up, comment lines 300-313.
