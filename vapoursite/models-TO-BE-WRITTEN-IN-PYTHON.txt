#I've read through the models designed by Edison and Hyun Ji, and here are the formatted models amended to further satisty the requirements and meet the convensions of Django models

# 2017-Apr-04 Edits (Geraldine): many minor edits
# removed shopping cart (too similar to transaction) and changed transaction to only have one game at a time
# don't think there's any reason to group games bought at the same time together and it makes database management and writing views easier

# Things that can be added if we have time: screenshots, system requirements, game version, game language
